# SONiC-telemetry

## Description
This repository contains implementation for the sonic system telemetry services:
- dial-in mode system telemetry server: `telemetry`
- dial-out mode system telemetry client `dialout_client_cli`

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Install __go__ in your system https://golang.org/doc/install. Requires golang1.8+.
* Install Git
* Install Libpcre3-dev using: 
        
        sudo apt install -y libpcre3-dev
        
* Install Customized version of libyang. These can obtained from a local sonic-buildimage folder and installed using the command:

        sudo dpkg -i ${buildimage}/target/debs/stretch/libyang*.deb

    or they can be downloaded from Jenkins and installed individually. Libyang, Libyang-cpp, Libyang-dbg, and Libyang-dev all need to be installed. https://sonic-jenkins.westus2.cloudapp.azure.com/job/generic/job/buildimage-baseimage/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/sonic-buildimage/target/debs/buster/
* Install PCRE http://www.pcre.org/ compiled with --enable-unicode-properties. A compiling guide can be found https://mac-dev-env.patrickbougie.com/pcre/

## Installing

There is a test program dialout_server_cli for collecting data from dial-out mode system telemetry client. _Note_: it is for testing purpose only. Only Go is a prerequisite.

    go get -u github.com/Azure/sonic-telemetry/dialout/dialout_server_cli

The binaries will be installed under $GOPATH/bin/, they may be copied to any SONiC switch and run there.

To use the telemetry server or dial-out client you can build SONiC-telemetry into a debian package and install it using the following steps:

    git clone https://github.com/Azure/sonic-mgmt-common.git
    git clone https://github.com/Azure/sonic-telemetry.git

    cd sonic-mgmt-common
    make
    sudo dh_install -psonic-mgmt-common -P/-v

    
    cd sonic-telemetry
    make
    sudo install testdata/database_config.json -t /var/run/redis/sonic-db       <- sometimes the sonic-db folder must be created manually.
    export CVL_SCHEMA_PATH=/usr/sbin/schema     <- This must be performed everytime it is run.


To test that it worked:
    
    ./build/bin/telemetry --help

Steps written with Ubuntu 18.04 in July 2020.

### Running
* See [SONiC gRPC telemetry](./doc/grpc_telemetry.md) for how to run dial-in mode system telemetry server
* See [SONiC telemetry in dial-out mode](./doc/dialout.md) for how to run dial-out mode system telemetry client
* See [gNMI Usage Examples](./doc/gNMI_usage_examples.md) for gNMI client usage examples.

### GitHub Workflow

We're following basic GitHub Flow. If you have no idea what we're talking about, check out [GitHub's official guide](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/). Note that merge is only performed by the repository maintainer.

Guide for performing commits:

* Isolate each commit to one component/bugfix/issue/feature
* Use a standard commit message format:

>     [component/folder touched]: Description intent of your changes
>
>     [List of changes]
>
> 	  Signed-off-by: Your Name your@email.com

For example:

>     swss-common: Stabilize the ConsumerTable
>
>     * Fixing autoreconf
>     * Fixing unit-tests by adding checkers and initialize the DB before start
>     * Adding the ability to select from multiple channels
>     * Health-Monitor - The idea of the patch is that if something went wrong with the notification channel,
>       we will have the option to know about it (Query the LLEN table length).
>
>       Signed-off-by: user@dev.null
